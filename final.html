                <p>Nyodema Women Empowerment Association (NWEA) is a community
                   based non-profit organisation formed by women to promote
                    development initiatives and financial independence for women.
                     Improving the life of women is critical for sustainable
                      development as they play a major role in our societies.
                       Women remain marginalised in many sectors in SSA and the
                        need to close the gender gap is paramount.
                        Currently there are 20 and growing of
                        such groups across the country affiliated with NWEA. The platform
                         has 5 women representatives in the NWEA 
                     executive who serve as a linked between the platform and NWEA.

                  <h3>EMPOWERMENT</h3>
                  <p>Empowering the women for financial independence focuses on 
                    granting mini loans to support and boost start-up business. Most women
                     find it difficult or lack the capacity to acquire loans from banks or other financial institutions. As a result, it hinders their ability to scale up small businesses. We therefore aim
                     to support them by giving them loans that only attract administrative cost.</p>
